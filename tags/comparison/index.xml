REST is focused on resource manipulation and provides a uniform interface for accessing and modifying resources, while RPC is focused on method invocation and provides a way for applications to access remote services and resources. REST is well-suited for web services that require flexibility and scalability, as it provides a uniform stateless interface for accessing and modifying resources.</description></item><item><title>When to use AWS Lambda and genezio?</title><link>/blog/when-to-use-aws-lambda-and-genezio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/when-to-use-aws-lambda-and-genezio/</guid><description>In recent years, serverless computing has become increasingly popular among developers seeking to simplify the deployment and management of their applications.
AWS Lambda is a well known serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to write functions which are executed in lightweight virtual machines (micro vms) in response to specific events. These virtual machines process requests before returning to a dormant state, with users only paying for the time they are active.</description></item></channel></rss>
