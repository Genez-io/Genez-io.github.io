productTextP1: "Because you, just like us, are passionate about developing new apps, new features. You want to bring them to your users as fast as possible. You want to focus on your code, develop, debug, release and iterate fast."
productTextP2: "Because you like writing elegant code. You donâ€™t want to lose time 
configuring backend servers, writing cumbersome GET URLs, 
you want your code to just run. And you want to write the backend 
code in your favorite language - be it Swift, Kotlin, etc."
productTextP3: "Because you care about the environment, just as we do.  We are passionate about 
power consumption, and we are optimizing the way the code is run towards our goal of zero overhead, fastest cold start delay, best CPU and memory resource allocation."
