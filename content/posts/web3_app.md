In this tutorial, I am going to show you how to create your first Web3 application on Ethereum using Blast API and genezio. You don‚Äôt have to know anything beforehand to follow along. I will introduce you to the most basic blockchain concepts and tools to get you from zero to hero in Web3 development. Excited? Let‚Äôs get started ü§©

After following through with this tutorial, you‚Äôll be able to brag to your friends about how you can:



1. Create a wallet with Metamask
2. Use Blast API to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet
3. Use NodeJS and Mongo DB to build a smart contract indexer to get the events happening on a blockchain
4. Use React to develop a minimalist frontend
5. Deploy a full stack application on genezio

You can find the complete project on [Github](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples/tree/master/javascript/blockchain). Check it out to get a feeling of how the project should look like when is complete.

## **Introduction**


### **What are you going to build?**

Today, you are going to build a **smart contract indexer** application. This app will be able to allow users to query events related to smart contracts on various blockchain networks. For this example, I chose to show you how to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet because it is the most popular blockchain that supports smart contracts.

Following, I am going to break down the steps you are going to get through:



1. Install dependencies and set up your project
2. Implement the server (backend) side of the project using Blast API
3. Implement the client (frontend) side of the project using React
4. Test and deploy your application using genezio


### **What is a blockchain?**

A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is decentralized. The ledger is maintained and updated by a network of computers, or nodes, that work together to validate and record transactions.

You can think of a blockchain as a network of computers that work together to create a public network that anyone can access and perform operations on, like sending tokens or running programs. Every node that‚Äôs part of this network has access to the data stored by the ledger and all of these nodes are ensuring that the data stays unchanged.


### **What are smart contracts?**

A smart contract is a self-executing program that automatically enforces the rules of an agreement between two or more parties. To make an analogy, if a blockchain can be associated with a large, public database, then a smart contract is an API that is able to read, write and execute commands over this database. 

Because smart contracts are executed by a decentralized network of nodes rather than a central entity, they have been built to be transparent, immutable, and difficult to tamper with. This makes them ideal for use in applications where trust is important, such as financial transactions, supply chain management, and digital identity verification.


## **Technical Tutorial**

Let‚Äôs install the dependencies needed for the smart contract indexer app. 

This step is going to introduce you to quite a few new tools for interacting with a blockchain. Don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôve never worked with them because I am going to walk you through every new concept.


### **Install dependencies**



1. Install [node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Create a Mongo Database
3. Create a wallet with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
4. Get access to an Ethereum endpoint using [Blast API](https://blastapi.io/)
5. Create a free account with [genezio](https://genez.io/)
6. Get a smart contract address from [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)


#### **Instal node and npm**

This is the easiest step. Head over to the [documentation page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install `node` and `npm` on your machine.


#### **Create a Mongo Database**

Go to the [MongoDB Cloud on Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and create a free account. Once logged in you can create a free demo database. Click on ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù and follow the steps that are popping up.

When you have the database up and running, you can get a URI to connect through it from your application. Click on _‚ÄúConnect‚Äù_:

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_14.webp)

Select _‚ÄúConnect your application‚Äù_:

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_23.webp)

There you can find the Mongo DB URI. Replace `<admin>`:`<password>` with the admin:password pair you configured when you created the DB:

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_15.webp)

#### **Create a wallet with Metamask**

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is a browser extension that will allow your browser to access the Ethereum blockchain. More than that, Metamask will also allow you to manage your ETH transactions.

To install Metamask, go to the plugin store of your browser and search for it. If you are a Google Chrome user, you can follow this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn). After adding the Metamask extension follow their quick walkthrough to create a wallet.

Note to yourself - Remember the password you set because it will be useful in the next steps.

When you successfully finish this step, your screen should look like this:

![Street Art Image](/posts/screenshot_1.webp)

The wallet created with Metamask will be used to connect to an Ethereum endpoint using Blast API in the next step.


#### **Get access to an Ethereum endpoint using Blast API**

A blockchain is very similar to a public network of machines. In order to connect to the network you either need to plug your machine into the network and receive an IP address of your own, or you can remotely connect to an existing machine and use it to interact with the network.

To interact with a given blockchain, you can either host and add your node to the blockchain or access an existing node. In this tutorial, we are going to use Blast API to get an endpoint to an existing node from the Ethereum Mainnet.

Head over to the [Blast API webpage](https://blastapi.io/) and click on _‚ÄúGet Endpoint‚Äù_ - this will allow you to interact with the blockchain using an existing node.

![Street Art Image](/posts/screenshot_2.webp)

From there, select _‚ÄúCreate a Consumer App‚Äù_ and connect using your Metamask wallet. Follow through the pop-ups that are appearing on your screen.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_3.webp)

Now you can set up a project to get access to an Ethereum endpoint. Select _‚ÄúAdd a new project‚Äù_. 

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_4.webp)

Enter a project name and select the _‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù_ environment. After you are happy with the name, hit the _‚ÄúCreate project‚Äù_ button.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_5.webp)

A dashboard with your active endpoints will appear. For now, there is no endpoint you are connected to, so let‚Äôs change that. Head to the _‚ÄúAvailable Endpoints‚Äù_ tab and select _‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù_ and, then, _‚ÄúEthereum Mainnet‚Äù_.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_6.webp)

Congrats ü•≥ Now you are connected to an Ethereum node. 

To be able to interact with the node in your application, click on the_ ‚ÄúActive Endpoints‚Äù_, on the _‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù_ widget and copy the RPC endpoint for later. This will allow you to send requests to the node.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_7.webp)


#### **Create a free account with genezio**

To brag about your first Web3 app to your friends, you‚Äôll need to host it somewhere on the cloud where they can easily access it and play around with it. For this, you can use genezio - a platform that is deploying you backend code on AWS Lambda and hosting your frontend.

Head to the [genezio login page](https://app.genez.io/auth/login) and create a free account by following the sign-up steps.


#### **Get a smart contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface)**

Head to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and choose the cutest NFT collection from trending.

Open the collection and select ‚ÄúView on EtherScan‚Äù. 

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_8.webp)

[EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/) is an analytics platform for smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Here you can see all of the events managed by this smart contract under the ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù tab.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_9.webp)

What is important on this page is:



1. The contract address - think of it as a unique name for the smart contract 
2. The ABI - the binary that the Ethereum Virtual Machine knows how to execute. 

Copy the contract address from the main page.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_10.webp)

Click on the _‚ÄúContract‚Äù_ tab and scroll down to the _‚ÄúContract ABI‚Äù_ section. Copy it from here.

![Street Art Image](/posts/ss_11.webp)

### **The server-side project**

Fire up your preferred IDE and your terminal and let‚Äôs get our hands dirty with some coding. You will use genezio to make your life easier while building your app.

At the end of this tutorial, the folder hierarchy of your project should be similar to this:
```
blockchain-project/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ genezio.yaml

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ event.js

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blockchain.js

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abi.js

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client/

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/

    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sdk/

    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
```
This is just a small spoiler to understand where things are going to fit in.


#### **Setup the server-side project**

Firstly, install genezio using npm:
```
npm install genezio -g 
```
After the installation is completed, you need to log in using this command:
```
genezio login
```
If you get stuck at any moment you can use `genezio help` or `genezio [command] help` to get more help with the tool.

To set up a new genezio project, create a fresh directory and initialize your configuration:
```
mdkir blockchain-project && cd blockchain-project

mkdir server && cd server

genezio init
```
After completing the wizard, your terminal should look like this:
```
What is the name of the project: blockchain-project

In what programming language do you want your SDK? (js, ts or swift) [default value: js]: js

What runtime will you use? Options: "node" or "browser". [default value: node]: node

Where do you want to save your SDK? [default value: ./sdk/]: ../client/src/sdk

Your genezio project was successfully initialized!

The genezio.yaml configuration file was generated. You can now add the classes that you want to deploy using the 'genezio addClass <className> <classType>' command.
```
Create a package.json using npm:
```
npm init -y
```
Install the web3 package to be able to interact programmatically with your Ethereum node:
```
npm install web3
```

#### **Implement the server-side class**

Create a `config.js` file and paste there the constants that you obtained in the steps above:
```javascript
// config.js

// Replace these values with your own

export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = <todo-paste-the-contract-address-here>

export const BLAST_API_RPC_ENDPOINT = <todo-paste-the-blast-api-rpc-endpoint-here>

export const MONGO_DB_URI = <todo-paste-the-mongo-db-uri-here>
```
Create an `abi.js` and paste there the Ethereum bytecode of the smart contract:
```javascript
// abi.js

export const abi = 

`

`
```
Before creating the class that will contain the logic of the app, install the web3 and mongoose npm packages by executing:
```
npm install web3 --save

npm install mongoose --save
```
Create a Mongo database model to save the events triggered on the smart contract. Create a directory named `models` and inside it, a file named `event.js`.
```javascript
// models/event.js

import mongoose from 'mongoose'

const eventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({

  id: String,

  name: String,

  parameters: Map,

  blockNumber: Number,

  logIndex: Number,

});

export const EventModel = mongoose.models.Event || mongoose.model('Event', eventSchema);
```
Create a `blockchain.js` file with a class name `BlockchainServer`. The class will have a constructor that will initialize the services used by the application - the endpoint to the Ethereum Blockchain using Blast API and it will set up the smart contract of your selected NFT.
```javascript
// blockchain.js

import Web3 from "web3"

import { mongoose } from "mongoose";

import { EventModel } from "./models/event.js"

import { abi } from "./abi.js";

import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, BLAST_API_RPC_ENDPOINT, MONGO_DB_URI} from "./config.js";

/**

 * The Blockchain server class that will be deployed on the genezio infrastructure.

 */

export class BlockchainServer {

    constructor() {

        mongoose.connect(MONGO_DB_URI);

        this.web3 = new Web3(BLAST_API_RPC_ENDPOINT);

        this.contract = new this.web3.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(abi), CONTRACT_ADDRESS);

        this.knownEventTokens = this.contract.options.jsonInterface.filter((token) => {

            return token.type === 'event';

        });

    }

}
```
Add a method in the class `BlockchainServer` to decode events from the blockchain. This method is going to be private.
```javascript
   /**

     * Private method that decodes an event and returns the name and the parameters.

     * 

     * This will not be callable using the genezio SDK. Only the public methods are exposed publicly.

     * 

     * @param {*} event 

     * @returns An object containing the name of the event and its parameters.

     */

    #decodeEvent(event) {

        // Retrieve the event declaration from the ABI

        const eventToken = this.knownEventTokens.find((knownEventToken) => {

            return knownEventToken.signature === event.topics[0];

        });

        if (!eventToken) {

            console.log('cannot process log %d', event.logIndex);

            return undefined;

        }

        // Decode the event

        const decodedEvent = this.web3.eth.abi.decodeLog(

            eventToken.inputs,

            event.data,

            event.topics.slice(1),

        )

        // Parse the parameters in a simple dictionary

        const parameters = {}

        eventToken.inputs.forEach((input) => {

            parameters[input.name] = decodedEvent[input.name]

        })

        return {

            name: eventToken.name,

            parameters,

        }

    }
```
Add a method that will sync the events triggered on the smart contract and index them in our database. This method will be called periodically by configuring a cron in `genezio.yaml`.
```javascript
   /**

     * Method that will be called periodically by the genezio infrastructure to index the events.

     * 

     * The frequency with which the method will be called can be modified from the genezio YAML file.

     * 

     */

    async sync() {

        // Get the current block number and request the last 100 blocks

        const blockNumber = await this.web3.eth.getBlockNumber()

        let events = await this.web3.eth.getPastLogs({ address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS, fromBlock: blockNumber - 50, toBlock: blockNumber });

        console.log(`New sync started with ${events.length} to save`)

        for (const event of events) {

            const decodedEvent = this.#decodeEvent(event)

            if (!decodedEvent) {

                continue

            }

            // Insert the missing events.

            await EventModel.findOneAndUpdate({ id: `${event.transactionHash}-${event.logIndex}` }, {

                $setOnInsert: {

                    id: `${event.transactionHash}-${event.logIndex}`,

                    name: decodedEvent.name,

                    parameters: decodedEvent.parameters,

                    blockNumber: event.blockNumber,

                    logIndex: event.logIndex

                }

            }, { upsert: true });

        }

    }
```
Lastly, add a method to get the saved events from the database.
```javascript
   /**

     * Method used to get all the events in a paginated way.

     * 

     * The method will be part of the genezio SDK.

     * 

     * @param {*} from The starting index of the first event.

     * @param {*} limit The number of events that will be part of the response.

     * @returns 

     */

    async GetEvents(from, limit) {

        console.log(`Received getEvents request with from = ${from} limit = ${limit}`)

        const count = await EventModel.count()

        console.log("Event count", count)

        const events = await EventModel.find(undefined, undefined, { skip: from, limit, sort: { "blockNumber": -1, "logIndex": -1 } })

        return {

            count,

            "events": events.map((event) => ({ id: event.id, name: event.name, parameters: event.parameters, blockNumber: event.blockNumber }))

        }

    }
```
Add `blockchain.js` to the genezio configuration file to prepare this class for deployment.

```
genezio addClass blockchain.js
```

Configure the `sync()` method in the `genezio.yaml` to be a cron that triggers every minute. Your `genezio.yaml` file should look like this:
```yaml
name: blockchain-project

region: us-east-1

sdk:

  language: js

  options:

    runtime: browser

  path: ../client/src/sdk/

classes:

  - path: ./blockchain.js

    type: jsonrpc

    methods:

      - name: sync

        type: cron

        cronString: "* * * * *"
```
Now the server side of your project is finished. You can continue to the next section where you‚Äôll build the client side. This is going to be a simple React app.


### **The client-side project**


#### **Setup the client-side project**

Create a `client` directory in the root directory of your project where you'll build the frontend application.

```
mkdir client && cd client
```

Create a new React app with the following command:

```
npx create-react-app .
```

Install the following packages to get Material React UI components:

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```


#### **Implement the client-side project**

Modify `src/App.js` as follows:
```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

import Pagination from '@mui/material/Pagination';

import List from '@mui/material/List';

import ListItem from '@mui/material/ListItem';

import ListItemText from '@mui/material/ListItemText';

import './App.css';

import { BlockchainServer } from "./sdk/blockchainServer.sdk"

const CHUNKS = 10

function App() {

  const [totalCount, setTotalCount] = useState(0)

  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0)

  const [events, setEvents] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {

    setCurrentIndex(0)

  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {

    // Use the SDK to get events from the BlockchainServer class hosted on genezio

    BlockchainServer.getEvents(currentIndex, CHUNKS)

      .then((response) => {

        setEvents(response.events)

        setTotalCount(response.count)

      })

      .catch((error) => {

        console.error("An error occurred!", error)

        setEvents([])

      })

  }, [currentIndex])

  const handleChange = (param, value) => {

    setCurrentIndex((value - 1) * CHUNKS)

  }

  return (

    <div className="App">

      <header className="App-header">

        <h1>Genezio Smart Contract Indexer</h1>

        <List sx={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 360, bgcolor: 'background.paper' }}>

          {events.map((event) =>

            <ListItem>

              <ListItemText primary={event.name} secondary={event.blockNumber + " " + JSON.stringify(event.parameters)} />

            </ListItem>

          )

          }

        </List>

        <div>

        <Pagination count={Math.floor(totalCount / CHUNKS)} onChange={handleChange}></Pagination>

        </div>

      </header>

    </div>

  );

}

export default App;
```

### **Test your project locally**

It is recommended to test your project locally before deploying it to make sure that everything works as expected. Execute the following commands to change the directory and start a local testing process:
```
cd server

npm install

genezio local
```
Your screen should look like this:
```
Generating your SDK...‚úÖ

Your code was deployed and the SDK was successfully generated!

Test your code at https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083

Server listening on port 8083
```
Right now the server side of your project is listening to port 8083. You can head to [https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083](https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083) to interact with it from the GUI.

You can also test the client side of your project. Do not stop the `genezio local` process. Open up a new terminal and head over to the `client` directory. There you can execute the following commands:
```
npm install

npm start
```

### **Deploy your project**


#### **Deploy the server (backend)**

To deploy the backend of your app, go to the `server` directory and deploy it with genezio. Hang in there because it might take a while.
```
cd server/

genezio deploy
```
After the project has been successfully deployed, your terminal should look like this:
```
Deploying your backend project to genezio infrastructure...

Generating your SDK...‚úÖ

Bundling your code and uploading it...

Bundling your code and uploading it...‚úÖ

Checking your credentials...‚úÖ

*playing elevator music*...‚úÖ

Doing the final touch-ups...‚úÖ

Your code was deployed and the SDK was successfully generated!

Your backend project has been deployed and is available at https://app.genez.io/project/<project-id-here>
```
Congrats again ü•≥ Now you can manage your project from the genezio Dashboard - you can test it, check the logs, or delete it if you don‚Äôt need it anymore.


#### **Deploy the client (frontend)**

To host the frontend with genezio, go to the `client` directory and prepare the frontend app:
```
cd client

npm install

npm run build
```
Now, go back to the `server` directory and deploy your frontend:
```
genezio deploy --frontend
```
After the frontend has been successfully deployed, your terminal should look like this:
```
Deploying your frontend to genezio infrastructure...

No subdomain specified in the genezio.yaml configuration file. We will provide a random one for you.

Frontend successfully deployed at https://cyan-light-owl.app.genez.io.
```
The frontend will be available at the link specified in the output. If you want to change the subdomain, configure it from the `genezio.yaml` file.

This is it! You now have your first, fully-functional Web3 App üöÄ You can directly brag about it to your friends by sharing the frontend link.
