      <description>Comparison This article has two main components: the history of the paradigms, and a tutorial on how to implement both paradigms using genezio.
Prerequisites for the tutorial:
Install npm Have an IDE or text editor installed, e.g. Visual Studio Code Create a free genezio account
Summary REST and RPC are two distinct approaches to web services and distributed computing. REST is focused on resource manipulation and provides a uniform interface for accessing and modifying resources, while RPC is focused on method invocation and provides a way for applications to access remote services and resources.</description>

      <description>In recent years, serverless computing has become increasingly popular among developers seeking to simplify the deployment and management of their applications.
AWS Lambda is a well known serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to write functions which are executed in lightweight virtual machines (micro vms) in response to specific events. These virtual machines process requests before returning to a dormant state, with users only paying for the time they are active.</description>
