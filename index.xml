Prerequisites for the tutorial:
Install npm Have an IDE or text editor installed, e.g. Visual Studio Code Create a free genezio account Summary REST and RPC are two distinct approaches to web services and distributed computing. REST is focused on resource manipulation and provides a uniform interface for accessing and modifying resources, while RPC is focused on method invocation and provides a way for applications to access remote services and resources.</description></item><item><title>Unlocking the potential of prompt engineering with genezio</title><link>/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-prompt-engineering-with-genezio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/unlocking-the-potential-of-prompt-engineering-with-genezio/</guid><description>This is a tutorial on how to build a movie recommendation system using the OpenAI API gpt.3-5-turbo based on the user input.
We are developing an application that generates a list of movies with summarized reviews. We aim to provide a seamless user experience by allowing the user to input their preferences and receive movie suggestions.
A complete demo app can be accessed at https://movie-guru.app.genez.io.

There are many ways of developing and exposing an API. Over time, frameworks were built, and doing this became much easier and user-friendlier. Today we will compare genezio with one of the major players in the market, Express. Let‚Äôs get started!
Express is one of the most popular frameworks used for backend programming.</description></item><item><title>When to use AWS Lambda and genezio?</title><link>/blog/when-to-use-aws-lambda-and-genezio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/when-to-use-aws-lambda-and-genezio/</guid><description>In recent years, serverless computing has become increasingly popular among developers seeking to simplify the deployment and management of their applications.
AWS Lambda is a well known serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to write functions which are executed in lightweight virtual machines (micro vms) in response to specific events. These virtual machines process requests before returning to a dormant state, with users only paying for the time they are active.</description></item><item><title>Create your first Web3 app</title><link>/blog/create-your-first-web3-app/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/create-your-first-web3-app/</guid><description>In this tutorial, I am going to show you how to create your first Web3 application on Ethereum using Blast API and genezio.

It will have two main components: the frontend which will consist of a simple chat-like interface, and the backend which exposes a function meant to rephrase your input text. Once implemented, the Rephrasing App can be used to rephrase text, write better articles or even upgrade your CV.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with genezio</title><link>/blog/getting-started-with-genezio/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/getting-started-with-genezio/</guid><description>Introduction Genezio is a serverless solution for seamlessly building full-stack web and mobile applications in a scalable and cost-efficient way.
