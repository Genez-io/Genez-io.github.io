AWS Lambda is a well known serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows developers to write functions which are executed in lightweight virtual machines (micro vms) in response to specific events.

It will have two main components: the frontend which will consist of a simple chat-like interface, and the backend which exposes a function meant to rephrase your input text. Once implemented, the Rephrasing App can be used to rephrase text, write better articles or even upgrade your CV.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with genezio</title><link>/blog/getting-started-with-genezio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/getting-started-with-genezio/</guid><description>Introduction genezio is a serverless solution for seamlessly building full-stack web and mobile applications in a scalable and cost-efficient way.
